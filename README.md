# HelloWorld
Repository for introductory project

I think I can add code in here too but I'm just gonna type text. Cool.

Now I'm adding more text in on the file in a new branch of the project. OK!

As per the "New World" project I'm adding info about myself.
-I just turned 26
-I'm trying to embrace technology more generally, and learn some computer engineering skills in particular.
-I run a small apparel business but I'm ready to take on another project and hope it will be in a technology-related field.
